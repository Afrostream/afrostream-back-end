      Afrostream Terms of Use
    </h1>
    <p>
      Afrostream provides a subscription service that allows our members to
      access movies and TV shows (“Afrostream content”) streamed over the
      Internet to certain Internet-connected TVs, computers and other devices
      ("Afrostream ready devices").
    </p>
    <p>
      The Afrostream service is provided to you by Afrostream Inc., a US limited
      liability company. These Terms of Use govern your use of our service. As
      used in these Terms of Use, "Afrostream service", "our service" or "the
      service" means the service provided by Afrostream for discovering and
      watching Afrostream content, including all features and functionalities,
      the website, and user interfaces, as well as all content and software
      associated with our service.

          Membership
        </h3>
        <p>
          1.1. Your Afrostream membership will continue week-to-week
          or month-to-month until terminated. To use the Afrostream service
          you must have Internet access and a Afrostream ready device, and
          provide a current, valid, accepted method of payment. Unless you
          cancel your membership before your weekly or monthly billing date,
          you authorize us to charge your next cycle’s membership fee to your
          Payment Method (see "Cancellation" below). You can find specific
          details regarding your Afrostream membership by visiting our
          website and clicking on the "Account" link available at the top of
          the pages of the Afrostream website under your profile name.

        <h3>
          Billing
        </h3>
        <p>
          2.1. Billing Cycle. The membership fee for the Afrostream service
          and any other charges you may incur in connection with your use of
          the service, such as taxes and possible transaction fees, will be
          charged on a monthly basis to your Payment Method on the calendar
          day corresponding to the commencement of the paying portion of your
          membership. In some cases your payment date may change, for example
          if your Payment Method has not successfully settled or if your paid
          membership began on a day not contained in a given month. Visit our
          website and click on the "Account" page and “Package Section” to
          see your next payment date.
        </p>
        <p>
          2.2. Payment Methods. If a payment is not successfully settled, due
          to expiration, insufficient funds, or otherwise, and you do not
          change your Payment Method or cancel your account, we may suspend
          your access to the service until we have obtained a valid Payment
          Method. Local tax charges may vary depending on the Payment Method
          used. Check with your Payment Method service provider for details.
        </p>
        <p>
          2.3. Cancellation. You can cancel your Afrostream membership at any
          time, and you will continue to have access to the Afrostream
          service through the end of your monthly billing period. To the
          extent permitted by the applicable law, payments are non-refundable
          and we do not provide refunds or credits for any partial-month
          membership periods or unwatched Afrostream content. To cancel, go
          to the "Account" page and follow the instructions for cancellation.
          If you cancel your membership, your account will automatically
          close at the end of your current billing period. To see when your
          account will close, go to the section "Package details" on the
          "Account" page. If you signed up for Afrostream using your account
          with a third party as a Payment Method and wish to cancel your
          Afrostream membership, you may need to do so through such third
          party, for example by visiting your account with the applicable
          third party and turning off auto-renew, or unsubscribing from the
          Afrostream service through that third party. You may also find
          billing information about your Afrostream membership by visiting
          your account with the applicable third party.
        </p>
        <p>
          2.4. Changes to the Price and Service Plans. We may change our
          service plans and the price of our service from time to time;
          however, any price changes or changes to our service plans will
          apply to you no earlier than 30 days following notice to you.

          3.1. You must be 18 years of age, or the age of majority in your
          province, territory or country, to become a member of the

          3.2. The Afrostream service and any content viewed through the
          service are for your personal and non-commercial use only. During
          your Afrostream membership we grant you a limited, non-exclusive,
          non-transferable, license to access the Afrostream service and view
          Afrostream content. Except for the foregoing limited license, no

        </p>
        <p>
          3.3. You may view the Afrostream content primarily within the
          country in which you have established your account and only in
          geographic locations where we offer our service and have licensed
          such content. The content that may be available to watch will vary
          by geographic location and will change from time to time. The
          number of devices on which you may simultaneously watch depends on
          your chosen subscription plan and is specified on the "Account"
          page.
        </p>
        <p>
          3.4. Afrostream regularly makes changes to the service, including
          the content library. In addition, we continually test various
          aspects of our service, including our website, user interfaces,
          promotional features and availability of Afrostream content. You
          can at any time opt-out of tests by visiting the "Account" page and
          changing the "Test participation" settings.
        </p>
        <p>
          3.5. You agree to use the Afrostream service, including all
          features and functionalities associated therewith, in accordance
          with all applicable laws, rules and regulations, or other
          restrictions on use of the service or content therein. You agree
          not to archive, reproduce, distribute, modify, display, perform,
          publish, license, create derivative works from, offer for sale, or
          use (except as explicitly authorized in these Terms of Use) content
          and information contained on or obtained from or through the
          Afrostream service. You also agree not to: circumvent, remove,
          alter, deactivate, degrade or thwart any of the content protections
          in the Afrostream service; use any robot, spider, scraper or other
          automated means to access the Afrostream service; decompile,
          reverse engineer or disassemble any software or other products or
          processes accessible through the Afrostream service; insert any
          code or product or manipulate the content of the Afrostream service
          in any way; or use any data mining, data gathering or extraction
          method. In addition, you agree not to upload, post, e-mail or
          otherwise send or transmit any material designed to interrupt,
          destroy or limit the functionality of any computer software or
          hardware or telecommunications equipment associated with the
          Afrostream service, including any software viruses or any other
          computer code, files or programs. We may terminate or restrict your
          use of our service if you violate these Terms of Use or are engaged
          in illegal or fraudulent use of the service.
        </p>
        <p>
          3.6. The quality of the display of the Afrostream content may vary
          from device to device, and may be affected by a variety of factors,
          such as your location, the bandwidth available through and/or speed
          of your Internet connection. The minimum connection speed for SD
          quality is 0.5 Mbps; however, we recommend a faster connection for
          improved video quality. A download speed of at least 5.0 Mbps per
          stream is recommended to receive HD content (defined as a
          resolution of 720p or higher). You are responsible for all Internet
          access charges. Please check with your Internet provider for
          information on possible Internet data usage charges. The time it
          takes to begin watching Afrostream content will vary based on a
          number of factors, including your location, available bandwidth at
          the time, the content you have selected and the configuration of
          your Afrostream ready device.
        </p>
        <p>
          3.7. The Afrostream software is developed by, or for, Afrostream
          and is designed to enable viewing of Afrostream content through
          Afrostream ready devices. The Afrostream software may vary by
          device and medium, and functionalities and features may also differ
          between devices. You acknowledge that the use of the service may
          require third party software that is subject to third party
          licenses. You agree that you may automatically receive updated
          versions of the Afrostream and related third-party software.

        <p>
          4.1. Account Access. The member who created the Afrostream
          account and whose Payment Method is charged (the "Account Owner") has
          access and control over the Afrostream account and the Afrostream ready
          devices that are used to access our service. To maintain control over
          the account and to prevent anyone from accessing the account (which
          would include information on viewing history for the account), the
          Account Owner should maintain control over the Afrostream ready devices
          that are used to access the service and not reveal the password nor
          details of the Payment Method associated with the account to anyone.
          You are responsible for updating and maintaining the accuracy of the
          information you provide to us relating to your account. We can
          terminate your account or place your account on hold in order to
          protect you, Afrostream or our partners from identity theft or other
          fraudulent activity.

          computer. If you do not want us to have this access, you should not

          between these Terms of Use and information provided by Customer
