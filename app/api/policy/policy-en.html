          use, including investigation of potential violations thereof, (c)

    <h3>
      Your Information and Rights
    </h3>
    <p>
      You can request access to your personal information, or correct or update
      out-of-date or inaccurate personal information we hold about you.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can most easily do this by visiting the "Your Account" portion of our
      website, where you have the ability to access and update a broad range of
      information about your account, including your contact information, your
      Afrostream payment information, and various related information about your

    <p>
      To make requests, or if you have any other question regarding our privacy
      practices, please contact us at privacy@afrostream.com. Please also see the
      Your Choices section of this Privacy Statement for additional choices
      regarding your information.
    </p>
    <p>
      We may reject requests that are unreasonable or not required by law,
      including those that would be extremely impractical, could require
      disproportionate technical effort, or could expose us to operational risks
      such as free trial fraud. We may retain information as required or
      permitted by applicable laws and regulations, including to honor your
      choices, for our billing or records purposes and to fulfill the purposes
      described in this Privacy Statement.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Security
    </h3>
    <p>
      We use reasonable administrative, logical, physical and managerial measures
      to safeguard your personal information against loss, theft and unauthorized
      access, use and modification. Unfortunately, no measures can be guaranteed
      to provide 100% security. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee the security of
      your information.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Children
    </h3>
    <p>
      You must be 18 years of age or older to subscribe to the Afrostream
      service. In certain jurisdictions, the age of majority may be older than
      18, in which case, you must satisfy that age in order to become a member.
      While individuals under the age of 18 may utilize the service, they may do
      so only with the involvement, supervision, and approval of a parent or
      legal guardian.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Changes to This Privacy Statement
    </h3>
    <p>
      We will update this Privacy Statement from time to time in response to
      changing legal, regulatory or operational requirements. We will provide
      notice of any such changes (including when they will take effect) in
      accordance with law. Your continued use of the Afrostream service after any
      such updates take effect will constitute acceptance of those changes. If

    <h3>
      Cookies and Internet Advertising
    </h3>
    <p>
      We and our Service Providers use cookies and other technologies (such as
      web beacons) for various reasons. For example, we use cookies and other
      technologies to make it easy to access our services by remembering you when
      you return, to provide and analyze our services, to learn more about our
      users and their likely interests, and to deliver and tailor marketing or
      advertising. We want you to be informed about our use of these
      technologies, so this notice explains the types of technologies we use,
      what they do and your choices regarding their use.
    </p>

          What are cookies?
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Cookies are small data files that are commonly stored on your
          device when you browse and use websites and online services. They
          are widely used to make websites work, or to work more efficiently,
          as well as to provide reporting information and assist with service
          or advertising personalization.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Cookies are not the only types of technology that enable this
          functionality; we also use other, similar types of technologies.
          See below for more information and examples.

          Why does Afrostream use cookies?
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          We and our Service Providers may use the following types of
          cookies:
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Essential cookies: These cookies are strictly necessary to provide
          our website or online service. For example, we or our Service
          Providers may use these cookies to authenticate and identify our
          members when they use our websites and applications so we can
          provide our service to them. They also help us to enforce our Terms
          of Use, prevent fraud and maintain the security of our service.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Performance and functionality cookies: These cookies are not
          essential, but help us to personalize and enhance your online
          experience with Afrostream. For example, they help us to remember
          your preferences and prevent you from needing to re-enter
          information you previously provided (for example, during member
          sign up). We also use these cookies to collect information (such as
          popular pages, conversion rates, viewing patterns, click-through
          and other information) about our visitors' use of the Afrostream
          service so that we can enhance and personalize our website and
          service and conduct market research. Deletion of these types of
          cookies will result in limited functionality of our service.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Advertising cookies: These cookies use information about your visit
          to this and other websites, such as the pages you visit, your use
          of our service or your response to ads and emails, to deliver ads
          that are more relevant to you. These types of ads are called
          "Interest-Based Advertising." Many of the advertising cookies
          associated with our service belong to our Service Providers.

        How Does Afrostream use Web Beacons and other Technologies?
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Web beacons (also known as clear gifs or pixel tags) often work in
        conjunction with cookies. We and our Service Providers may use them for
        similar purposes as cookies, such as to understand and enhance the use
        of our service, improve site performance, monitor visitor traffic and
        actions on our site, and understand interactions with our marketing
        (including email and online ads on third party sites). Because web
        beacons often work in conjunction with cookies, in many cases,
        declining cookies will impair the effectiveness of web beacons.
      </p>
